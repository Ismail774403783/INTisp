# Hello [Friend Name Here],

I am happy to announce the first release of our hosting control panel. We released a hosting control panel today called Webister, it is completely written in PHP. It does not use any other language except php, bash, and html.

What can it do and what does this have anything to do with minecraft?
Our web hosting control panel connects to your minecraft server and/or buycraft via plugin. It also can act as your server website.

### Is it free?
Yes our software is completely free, however we may choose to release plugins in the near future that cost money.
